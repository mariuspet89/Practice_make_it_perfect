Grouping is done with two or three components mainly; it depends on the specific case. These components include:

Grouping by Key: Fields are grouped horizontally on the same line based on their keys. Pairs of fields with matching key suffixes are identified and grouped together using a unique group ID. The fields are organized in a group with a layout type of "hbox."

Grouping by Column: Fields are grouped vertically by column. Pairs of fields with matching keys and x-coordinates are identified between consecutive lines. They are assigned the same group ID and organized in a group with a layout type of "vbox."

Grouping by Position: Fields are grouped horizontally on the same line based on their positions. Group starter fields, which are label fields starting with color WHT or attribute HI, are identified. Consecutive fields on the same line that are not already part of a group and not group starters are grouped together using a unique group ID. The fields are organized in a group with a layout type of "hbox."

These grouping techniques help organize related fields together, providing a structured representation of the converted format data.
